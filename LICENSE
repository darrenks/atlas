I can't imagine how this code would be useful for commercial use, but in the event that you would like to make money off of it, I would want a small cut so please email me so we can work something out.

I think Altas has some cool new ideas and I hope that they are used in future languages, please credit Atlas if you use specific ideas or techniques pioneered in it.
