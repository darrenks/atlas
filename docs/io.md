Input is a regular string value accessible using the variable `I`, but thanks to laziness, interactive programs can still be written.

Each line that doesn't begin with an assignment is output followed by a newline (and if there are none then the last assigment is printed).
Output automatically converts any type to a string by joining with spaces then newlines then double newlines.
