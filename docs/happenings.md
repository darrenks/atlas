BTW there was a working Befunge-like 2D mode where you draw your program's graph rather than use variable names and parenthesis - it was smart about deducing connections so was probably even more concise. It was very interesting, but I removed it for now to focus on teaching circular programming rather than exploring a wacky idea (check out the very first commit of this language for a working prototype if you are curious).
