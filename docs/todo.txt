programs that infinite loop statically
a=a - should be nil
infinite type - would be nice to give proper error

==== syntax ====
in implicit cons !atom should do a zipped cons since atoms cannot zip
consider trying to make == a single op and be smart about deciding when it means assignment
allow indented multiline strings with no delimiters
allow newlines followed by indentation in complicated expressions
   this is even lower precedence than a space
   make sure else/then don't need to be indented

brackets to increase zip level, op to not be replicated inside, optimization to not replicate constants
   every brackets must then have a use of that special op so make it implicit to last list atom if missing, similarly if no brackets are present but that special op is, the whole program should be bracketed

==== runtime improvements ====
remove need for pad, better greatest fixed point calculation

use heap for computation instead of lambdas so that it can handle large lists
   possibly define most ops in Atlas to make porting easier

port to nim
   compile to js too
      have mouse over show type or even values

==== add many ops ====
overload char/int
need ops like take_while
filter would be handy
logical and/or not
comparisons?
negation
min/max
add !+ /etc to fold or scan on + and other scalar ops (maybe !!+ for scanl)
more read/parsing options on strings

===== misc ====
take command line args
repl mode (possibly reverse tokens to make it more like a calculator)

==== assignment reduction ====
add ops for looking forward and back, a=a+1 -> [+], (a=1+2)+a -> {+}1+2

==== paren reduction ====
using white space presense to lower precedence
flip, an op modifier

==== type improvements ====
allow swapping if arg types don't match
if knew what the return type needed to be could do things like make max lazy (like logical or) if number used as bool (also fyi, should truthy be >0 or non zero?)
